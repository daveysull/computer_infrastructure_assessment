# computer_infrastructure_assessment

This repository conatains the work I will be doing over the next 12 weeks for my computer infrastructur module.

The "data" folder contains work that will mostly be done through the terminal / command line. There are 8 tasks in total that make up 40% of my final grade. In task 8 I will be writing a report to summarize the work I did in the previous tasks. To help with this task I have made a file called "task_notes" to document the work being done.

In this repository there is a "weather.sh" script which makes up another 40% of my grade. In this project I will create a GitHub Actions Workflow.

The final 20% of the grade is mad eup by having a well organised repository that showcases the work that has been done.
